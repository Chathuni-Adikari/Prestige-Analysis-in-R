🌟 Prestige Analysis in R 🌟

📊 Overview

This project systematically examines the relationships between occupational prestige, income, and education levels using R programming language. The dataset, Prestige_New.csv, encompasses a diverse range of professions and includes their prestige scores, income levels, and education requirements. The study employs rigorous statistical methods, including hypothesis testing, correlation analysis, and data visualizations, to derive insightful conclusions about societal occupational structures.

🔬 Features

📊 Descriptive Statistics

Computes fundamental statistical measures, including mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and summary statistics to provide a comprehensive overview of income, prestige, and education distributions.

🌀 Central Tendency & Bell Curves

Illustrates the normal distribution curves of key variables to visualize trends and detect potential deviations from a normal distribution.

📈 Statistical Tests

Pairwise t-tests: Conducts comparisons between different occupation types to evaluate statistical differences in prestige.

ANOVA test: Analyzes variation in prestige across multiple occupational groups to determine if significant disparities exist.

Shapiro-Wilk test: Assesses data normality, ensuring the validity of parametric statistical tests.

Spearman & Pearson correlation: Measures the strength and direction of associations between prestige, income, and education to establish potential causality or dependencies.

🌟 Visualizations

Box plots: Facilitate visual comparison of prestige scores across different occupation types, highlighting outliers and central tendencies.

Scatter plots: Graphically represent the relationship between prestige & education and prestige & income, demonstrating potential correlations.

Regression Line: Models the linear relationship between prestige and income, providing insights into predictive tendencies.
